System Data Recorder is an open source project, started late 2005,
to provide standard server infrastructure performance monitoring for 
Linux and Solaris based systems.

\noindent
\newline
Some ideas went into SDR as a frustration using other types of performance 
monitoring systems, some other simple ended up as being important and useful. 
During 2007 concepts from Guerrilla Capacity Planning of Dr. Neil Gunther made 
ground rules for future SDR versions.

\noindent
Many people contributed ideas, suggestions over the time. To all contributors, 
many thanks, for your support !

\noindent
\newline
Finally, thanks to LATEX community for keeping alive the project over the years.
The current manual has been prepared using the professional \LaTeX{} document 
processing system.
