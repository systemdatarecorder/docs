\chapter{Raw Data Format}
The current section describes the sdrd raw data format used by
SDR Recorders.

% GENERAL RULES %
\section*{General Rules}
All SDR recorders follow several simple rules no matter of the release
version nor operating system platform.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Raw Data File Format: ASCII text file, flatfile
\item Fields: contains a number of fields, storing the recorded metrics
\item Field Separator: character ':', ASCII code: Dec 58, Hex 3A
\end{enumerate}

\section{sdrd 0737}
\noindent
The current SDRD 0737 daw data format describes how data is arranged and
presented during the recording process, the order of all fields and 
their data type. The current format applies to SDR 0.73.7 or greater
releases only.

% SYSREC
\subsection*{sysrec}
sysrec is responsible for overall system performance metrics. The recoder
stores all the performance metrics simple and compact. The recorder
will output the sdrd format release using version \\-V option.


\subsubsection*{Linux x86/64}
sysrec under Linux does work under two modes: the default mode where the
recorder records 32 metrics and the extended mode where the recorder
reports 43 metrics.
